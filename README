   Use
     1) Create a black & white bitmap of the same dimensions as the LCD screen in question
           128 x 64 for dogm-128 modules
           Demark a dot on the bitmap by
     2) Run bitmap-ST7565R.py with appropriate arguments 
     3) Include the generated header file in your project
     4) Access the output array in a two dimenional manner : graphics_lcdmap[PAGE_NUMBER][COLUMN_NUMBER]
	    

	Example
	   Say I wanted to create a picture of a trashcan and build a bitmap to use. I would do the following:
	   1) create a 128x64 bit bitmap in mspaint or whatever editor I please. Save to C:\img\trash.bmp
	   2) Run the program: python bitmap-ST7565.py C:\img\trash.bmp C:\src\great_project\trash.h
	   3) Include the trash file in the project: #include "trash.h"
	   4) Access the output array: 
	      for (int page = 0; page < 8; page++)
             for (int col = 0; col < 128; col++)
			    lcd_write_graphics(page, col, graphics_trash[page][col]);
